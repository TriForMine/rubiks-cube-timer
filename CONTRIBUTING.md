## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React & Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices (keys, effects, etc.)
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed

### Code Style

- **Formatting**: We use Prettier for code formatting
- **Linting**: Follow ESLint rules defined in the project
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for files and PascalCase for components
- **Import order**: Group imports logically (external, internal, relative)

### Example Code Style

```typescript
// Good
interface TimerState {
  isRunning: boolean;
  startTime: number | null;
  currentTime: number;
}

const Timer: React.FC<TimerProps> = ({ onTimeUpdate }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<TimerState>({
    isRunning: false,
    startTime: null,
    currentTime: 0
  });

  const handleStart = useCallback(() => {
    setState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      isRunning: true,
      startTime: performance.now()
    }));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="timer-container">
      {/* Timer UI */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS & Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS custom properties for theme values
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Accessibility tests**: Ensure features are accessible

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Timer Component', () => {
  it('should start timer when spacebar is pressed', () => {
    // Arrange
    render(<Timer />);
    
    // Act
    fireEvent.keyDown(document, { key: ' ' });
    
    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText(/running/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Language Support

We're planning to add support for multiple languages to make the timer accessible to the global speedcubing community. Here's how you can contribute:

#### Supported Languages (Planned)

**High Priority Languages:**
- English (en) - Default âœ…
- Spanish (es) - Large speedcubing community
- Chinese Simplified (zh-CN) - Major cubing market
- French (fr) - Strong European presence
- German (de) - Active community
- Portuguese (pt) - Growing community
- Japanese (ja) - Cubing innovation hub

**Additional Languages:**
- Russian (ru)
- Korean (ko) 
- Italian (it)
- Dutch (nl)
- Polish (pl)

#### Translation Guidelines

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Maintain speedcubing terminology consistency
2. **WCA Standards**: Follow World Cube Association terminology where applicable
3. **Context Awareness**: Consider cultural differences in time formats and measurements
4. **Completeness**: Translate all user-facing text including:
   - Timer interface elements
   - Statistics labels and descriptions
   - Settings and configuration options
   - Error messages and notifications
   - Help text and tooltips

#### Implementation Notes

When internationalization is implemented, it will use modern i18n practices:

- Support for multiple languages with proper localization
- Maintain speedcubing terminology consistency across languages
- Follow WCA terminology standards where applicable
- Consider cultural differences in time formats and measurements

#### Contributing Translations

1. Check existing translation issues on GitHub
2. Create a new issue for your target language
3. Follow the translation key structure
4. Test translations in the UI
5. Submit PR with complete language pack
