## Scramble Generation

The scramble generator creates WCA-compliant 3x3x3 cube scrambles:

- **Standard Length**: 20 moves (configurable 15-30)
- **Valid Moves**: R, L, U, D, F, B with modifiers (', 2)
- **Smart Algorithm**: Prevents invalid sequences and ensures randomness
- **Visual Display**: Moves grouped for easy reading

### Scramble Rules

- No consecutive moves on the same face (e.g., R R')
- No alternating opposite faces (e.g., R L R)
- Proper randomization using cryptographically secure methods

## Data Format

Times are stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "1640995200000",
  "time": 15420,
  "scramble": "R U R' U' R' F R F' U2 R U' R'",
  "date": "2023-12-31T23:59:59.999Z",
  "penalty": "+2"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `id`: Unique timestamp identifier
- `time`: Solve time in milliseconds
- `scramble`: WCA scramble string
- `date`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `penalty`: Optional penalty ("DNF" or "+2")

## FAQ

**Q: How accurate is the timer?**
A: The timer uses `performance.now()` for sub-millisecond accuracy and updates every 10ms during solving.

**Q: Are the scrambles WCA official?**
A: Yes, the scrambles follow WCA regulations for 3x3x3 cubes with proper move notation and sequence validation.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes, the app works offline after the initial load thanks to Next.js static optimization.

**Q: How do I backup my times?**
A: Use the Export function in Settings to download a JSON file with all your data.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes, all data is stored locally in your browser. Nothing is sent to external servers.
