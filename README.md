1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TriForMine/rubiks-cube-timer.git
   cd rubiks-cube-timer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
bun run build

# Start the production server
bun run start
```

## Usage

### Basic Timer Operation

1. **Starting a Solve**
   - Press and hold the SPACEBAR
   - The timer will show "HOLD" state (red indicator)
   - Continue holding until you see "READY" state (yellow indicator)
   - Release SPACEBAR to start the timer

2. **Stopping the Timer**
   - Press SPACEBAR while the timer is running
   - Your time will be automatically recorded
   - A new scramble will be generated

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `SPACE` | Start/Stop timer |
| `N` | Generate new scramble |
| `DELETE` | Delete last time |

**Note**: The timer currently requires a physical keyboard and is optimized for desktop use. Mobile device support is planned for future releases.

### Managing Times

- **View Details**: Click on any time in the list to expand details
- **Add Penalties**: Use the +2 or DNF buttons in expanded view
- **Delete Times**: Click the trash icon to remove individual times
- **Export Data**: Use Settings → Export Times to backup your data
- **Import Data**: Use Settings → Import Times to restore from backup

### Statistics Explained

- **Best**: Your fastest solve time
- **Mean**: Average of all solve times
- **Ao5**: Average of 5 (best and worst times removed)
- **Ao12**: Average of 12 (best and worst times removed)
- **Ao50**: Average of 50 (best and worst times removed)
- **Ao100**: Average of 100 (best and worst times removed)

## Scramble Generation

The scramble generator creates WCA-compliant 3x3x3 cube scrambles:

- **Standard Length**: 20 moves (configurable 15-30)
- **Valid Moves**: R, L, U, D, F, B with modifiers (', 2)
- **Smart Algorithm**: Prevents invalid sequences and ensures randomness
- **Visual Display**: Moves grouped for easy reading

### Scramble Rules

- No consecutive moves on the same face (e.g., R R')
- No alternating opposite faces (e.g., R L R)
- Proper randomization using cryptographically secure methods

## Data Format

Times are stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "1640995200000",
  "time": 15420,
  "scramble": "R U R' U' R' F R F' U2 R U' R'",
  "date": "2023-12-31T23:59:59.999Z",
  "penalty": "+2"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `id`: Unique timestamp identifier
- `time`: Solve time in milliseconds
- `scramble`: WCA scramble string
- `date`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `penalty`: Optional penalty ("DNF" or "+2")

## FAQ

**Q: How accurate is the timer?**
A: The timer uses `performance.now()` for sub-millisecond accuracy and updates every 10ms during solving.

**Q: Are the scrambles WCA official?**
A: Yes, the scrambles follow WCA regulations for 3x3x3 cubes with proper move notation and sequence validation.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes, the app works offline after the initial load thanks to Next.js static optimization.

**Q: Does this work on mobile devices?**
A: Currently, the timer requires a physical keyboard for proper operation and is optimized for desktop use. Mobile support is planned for future releases.

**Q: How do I backup my times?**
A: Use the Export function in Settings to download a JSON file with all your data.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes, all data is stored locally in your browser. Nothing is sent to external servers. See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for more details.

**Q: Can I contribute to this project?**
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.
